## **Multi Treading**

When handling 100k requests with a Java Spring Boot application on a system with **4 CPU cores** and **4GB of RAM**, the performance and resource utilization largely depend on your application's threading model, specifically **`server.tomcat.threads.min`** and **`server.tomcat.threads.max`** in the Tomcat configuration. Here's how this works:

---

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Tomcat Thread Pool**:
   - **`server.tomcat.threads.min`**: Minimum number of threads kept alive to handle requests.
   - **`server.tomcat.threads.max`**: Maximum number of threads that can handle requests simultaneously.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - Each incoming request is assigned a thread.
   - If your application calls another API internally (blocking I/O), the thread handling the request remains idle until the API response is received.
   - Too many threads can lead to resource contention, while too few threads can cause queuing delays.

---

### **How It Works in This Scenario:**

1. **Handling Requests**:
   - Suppose `server.tomcat.threads.max = 200` (a common default for Tomcat):
     - At most, 200 requests can be handled concurrently.
     - Requests beyond 200 are queued in the request queue.
     - If the queue is full, new requests are rejected or dropped.
     - mostly in kubernates or prod grade application healthcheck api get queued and not responds before timout and get rejected and container or pod gets killed and new one will spawn.

2. **Internal API Calls**:
   - If each request involves a blocking call to an external API, the thread stays occupied but idle during the call.
   - High blocking times will reduce the system's ability to handle many concurrent requests.

3. **CPU and RAM Usage**:
   - **CPU**: Threads themselves don't consume much CPU during I/O wait. But high CPU usage might occur due to request processing or API response handling.
   - **RAM**: Each thread consumes stack memory (typically 512KB–1MB). For 200 threads, this could use 100–200MB just for thread stacks, leaving less memory for the heap, caches, and other resources.

---

### **Pros and Cons of Min/Max Thread Configuration**

#### **1. High `maxThreads` (e.g., 500–1000)**
- **Pros**:
  - More concurrent requests handled.
  - Fewer chances of request rejection or queuing delays.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher memory usage: Threads consume stack memory.
  - More context switching: Can degrade CPU performance, especially on a 4-core CPU.
  - Increased GC pressure: Less heap memory available for application logic.

#### **2. Low `maxThreads` (e.g., 50–100)**
- **Pros**:
  - Reduced memory usage per thread.
  - Less context switching, better CPU efficiency.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited concurrent request handling capacity.
  - High queuing delays and potential request rejection under heavy load.

---

### **Optimal Configuration**
1. **Thread Pool Sizing**:
   - Use **`maxThreads` = 4 × Cores** for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., processing-heavy workloads).
   - Use **`maxThreads` = 50–200** for I/O-bound tasks (like your scenario with API calls).

2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Leverage **non-blocking I/O** with Spring's **WebFlux** or use asynchronous features (`CompletableFuture`, `@Async`).
   - Reduces the need for blocking threads, allowing the system to handle more requests with fewer threads.

3. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like **JVisualVM**, **JProfiler**, or **Prometheus** to monitor thread usage, memory, and CPU under load.
   - Tune parameters based on real-world data.

---

### **Recommendations for 100k Requests**
1. **Thread Configuration**:
   - Set `server.tomcat.threads.min = 10` and `server.tomcat.threads.max = 200` initially.
   - Monitor the system under load to adjust further.

2. **Queue Size**:
   - Use `server.tomcat.accept-count` to configure the maximum queue length for incoming requests (e.g., 1000).

3. **Enable Async Processing**:
   - Use non-blocking HTTP clients (e.g., **WebClient** instead of `RestTemplate`).

4. **API Caching**:
   - If possible, cache responses from the internal API to reduce load and response times.

5. **Scaling**:
   - For sustained 100k requests, consider horizontal scaling using **load balancers** and multiple application instances.

---

### **Pros and Cons of the Approach**

#### **Pros**:
- Flexible configuration for different workloads.
- Non-blocking programming reduces thread contention.
- Horizontal scaling can accommodate even higher loads.

#### **Cons**:
- Improper tuning can lead to resource exhaustion or underutilization.
- Asynchronous code can be complex to debug and maintain.
- Memory constraints (4GB RAM) may limit scalability without optimization.

By balancing your thread pool size, adopting asynchronous APIs, and caching where feasible, your Spring Boot application can efficiently handle high request volumes.





To monitor requests at a granular level and detect rejections in your Java Spring Boot application, you can use a combination of **application logs**, **metrics collection**, and **monitoring tools**. Here's how to achieve this:

---

### **1. Application Logs**
#### Log Rejected Requests:
- Enable detailed logging in your application to track rejected or dropped requests.
- Use a **`RejectedExecutionHandler`** if you're using a custom thread pool.

Example for Tomcat thread pool monitoring:
```java
@Bean
public TomcatServletWebServerFactory tomcatServletWebServerFactory() {
    return new TomcatServletWebServerFactory() {
        @Override
        protected void customizeConnector(Connector connector) {
            connector.setAttribute("maxThreads", 200);
            connector.setAttribute("acceptCount", 100);
        }

        @Override
        protected void postProcessContext(Context context) {
            context.getPipeline().addValve(new AccessLogValve() {
                {
                    setPattern("%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b %D");
                    setDirectory("logs");
                    setPrefix("access_log");
                    setSuffix(".log");
                }
            });
        }
    };
}
```

To manage the minimum and maximum number of threads for CPU and IP-bound tasks in a Java application, you can adjust your thread pool settings based on the nature of the task. Here’s a general guide for handling both CPU-bound and I/O-bound (IP-bound) tasks:

### CPU-bound tasks:

CPU-bound tasks are computationally intensive and typically require more CPU resources. For these tasks, the optimal number of threads is generally equal to the number of available processors (cores) on the machine. This is because creating more threads than available CPU cores can lead to excessive context switching, degrading performance.

#### Recommended approach for CPU-bound tasks:

* **Core pool size**: Set to the number of available processors (`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`).
* **Max pool size**: Can be the same as the core pool size or a little higher, depending on how many threads your application can handle without causing thread contention.

**Example:**

```java
int availableProcessors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
ExecutorService cpuBoundExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    availableProcessors, // Core pool size
    availableProcessors, // Max pool size
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, // Keep-alive time
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>() // Work queue
);
```

### I/O-bound tasks (IP-bound):

I/O-bound tasks (such as waiting for network responses, disk I/O, or database calls) are typically constrained by waiting time, not CPU. For these tasks, it's often beneficial to have more threads than CPU cores to ensure that while one thread is waiting for I/O, others can continue executing.

#### Recommended approach for I/O-bound tasks:

* **Core pool size**: Start with a small number of threads (e.g., 10).
* **Max pool size**: Set to a higher value depending on the expected workload and available system resources. This can often be set much higher than the number of available cores.

**Example:**

```java
int availableProcessors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
ExecutorService ioBoundExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    10, // Core pool size
    200, // Max pool size (adjust based on system capacity)
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, // Keep-alive time
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>() // Work queue
);
```

### Dynamic adjustment with `ForkJoinPool` (optional):

If you are using Java's `ForkJoinPool` for parallel computing tasks, you can dynamically adjust the number of threads used, but you still want to avoid overloading the CPU with too many threads.

**Example for `ForkJoinPool`:**

```java
ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = new ForkJoinPool(
    availableProcessors, // Core pool size
    ForkJoinPool.defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory, // Custom thread factory (optional)
    null, // Uncaught exception handler (optional)
    false // Whether or not the pool should shut down
);
```

### Summary:

* **CPU-bound tasks**: Use a thread pool size equal to the number of available CPU cores.
* **I/O-bound tasks**: Use a thread pool with a core size that's lower than the CPU count and a higher max pool size to handle waiting on external resources.

By carefully tuning these values, you can ensure that your application uses threads efficiently based on the task type.

---

### Access logs include:
- **Status Codes**: Look for `429 Too Many Requests` or `503 Service Unavailable`.
- **Response Time**: Helps identify slow responses due to queuing or resource exhaustion.

---

### **2. Metrics Collection**
#### Use Actuator Metrics:
Spring Boot provides **Actuator** to expose detailed metrics about your application.

1. **Enable Actuator** in `application.properties`:
```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoint.metrics.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.enabled=true
```

2. **Monitor Thread Pool Metrics**:
   - Use `tomcat.threads.active`, `tomcat.threads.config.max`, and `tomcat.threads.busy` to monitor thread usage.
   - Example: `/actuator/metrics/tomcat.threads.active`.

3. **Request Metrics**:
   - Use `http.server.requests` to monitor request counts, response status codes, and latencies.
   - Example: `/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests`.

---

### **3. Monitoring Tools**
#### Use External Monitoring Tools for Granular Insights:
1. **Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - **Prometheus**: Collect metrics from Actuator's `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.
   - **Grafana**: Visualize metrics using Prometheus as a data source.

   Metrics to track:
   - Request counts by status code (`2xx`, `4xx`, `5xx`).
   - Rejected requests (e.g., `503` responses).
   - Thread pool saturation (active vs max threads).

2. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**:
   - Use **Logstash** to parse logs for rejected requests or specific status codes.
   - Visualize trends in **Kibana** dashboards.

3. **APM Tools**:
   Tools like **New Relic**, **Dynatrace**, or **Datadog** offer deep insights into application performance.
   - Monitor request rejection rates.
   - Get alerts for thread pool saturation or high response times.

---

### **4. Custom Rejection Monitoring**
If you use a custom thread pool or want more granular control, you can implement monitoring directly in your code.

#### Example: Custom Thread Pool with Monitoring
```java
@Bean
public Executor taskExecutor() {
    ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    executor.setCorePoolSize(10);
    executor.setMaxPoolSize(200);
    executor.setQueueCapacity(1000);
    executor.setThreadNamePrefix("CustomExecutor-");
    executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler((r, e) -> {
        log.error("Request rejected: {}", r.toString());
    });
    return executor;
}
```

#### Expose Metrics:
- Track rejected requests with a counter metric.
- Use libraries like **Micrometer** to expose metrics:
```java
@Autowired
private MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

private Counter rejectedRequests = Counter.builder("custom.executor.rejected")
                                          .description("Number of rejected requests")
                                          .register(meterRegistry);

executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler((r, e) -> {
    rejectedRequests.increment();
    log.error("Request rejected: {}", r.toString());
});
```

---

### **5. Alerts and Notifications**
Set up alerts in your monitoring tool:
- **CPU Usage**: Alert if it exceeds 80%.
- **Thread Pool Saturation**: Alert if `tomcat.threads.active` approaches `tomcat.threads.config.max`.
- **High Response Latency**: Monitor `http.server.requests` for requests taking longer than a threshold.
- **Request Rejection**: Alert on increasing `503` or `429` responses.

---

### **6. Testing for Rejections**
Simulate high load to identify bottlenecks:
- Use tools like **Apache JMeter**, **Gatling**, or **k6** to send 100k requests.
- Monitor system metrics and logs during the test.

---

### **Summary of Steps**
1. Enable **detailed access logs** to detect rejected requests.
2. Use Spring Boot Actuator to expose **thread pool and request metrics**.
3. Integrate with tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **APM tools** for granular monitoring.
4. Implement custom rejection logging if needed.
5. Simulate high load and analyze metrics to fine-tune configurations.

This approach ensures you can monitor and act on request rejections effectively.



## **kubernates config for java application**
Your provided Helm values file for the Java application config is well-structured, and it appears that you are handling a high-throughput application with 5000 transactions per second (TPS). Given the application's nature of interacting with a third-party vendor and translating XML and SOAP calls, here are some key validations and suggestions for improvement:

---

### **Analysis and Suggestions**
#### 1. **Replica Count**
   - Current: `replicaCount: 8`
   - **Validation**: This seems reasonable for an average TPS of 5000/s, assuming each pod can handle approximately 625 TPS. However, ensure that horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) is configured if the load fluctuates.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Enable HPA to dynamically adjust the replicas based on CPU/memory utilization.
     - Example for HPA:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
       kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
       metadata:
         name: java-app-hpa
       spec:
         scaleTargetRef:
           apiVersion: apps/v1
           kind: Deployment
           name: java-app
         minReplicas: 4
         maxReplicas: 16
         metrics:
         - type: Resource
           resource:
             name: cpu
             target:
               type: Utilization
               averageUtilization: 80
       ```

---

#### 2. **Resource Requests and Limits**
   - Current:
     ```yaml
     requests:
       cpu: 80m
       memory: 4.5Gi
     limits:
       memory: 4.5Gi
     ```
   - **Validation**: 
     - The CPU request (`80m`) is very low for a high-throughput application. This may lead to CPU throttling under load.
     - Memory allocation (`4.5Gi`) is high, which seems appropriate given the JVM heap size (`-Xmx2816m` and `-Xms2816m`).
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Increase the CPU request to at least `500m` to handle XML and SOAP processing efficiently.
     - Set a CPU limit to `1000m` to prevent excessive resource usage per pod.
     - Use proportional CPU and memory allocation. Example:
       ```yaml
       resources:
         requests:
           cpu: 500m
           memory: 4.5Gi
         limits:
           cpu: 1000m
           memory: 4.5Gi
       ```

---

#### 3. **Liveness and Readiness Probes**
   - Current:
     ```yaml
     livenessProbe:
       initialDelaySeconds: 300
     readinessProbe:
       initialDelaySeconds: 120
       periodSeconds: 5
       successThreshold: 1
       failureThreshold: 1
     ```
   - **Validation**:
     - `initialDelaySeconds` is high for both probes. This could delay detecting unresponsive pods or marking them ready.
     - Readiness probe is critical for managing traffic distribution; ensure it checks actual application readiness (e.g., health endpoint).
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Lower `initialDelaySeconds` for the readiness probe to 30 seconds or less.
     - Add specific `httpGet` or `tcpSocket` checks to the probes:
       ```yaml
       livenessProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /healthz
           port: 8080
         initialDelaySeconds: 30
         periodSeconds: 10
       readinessProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /readyz
           port: 8080
         initialDelaySeconds: 30
         periodSeconds: 5
         successThreshold: 1
         failureThreshold: 3
       ```

---

#### 4. **JVM Options**
   - Current:
     ```yaml
     JVM_OPTIONS: >-
       -Xmx2816m
       -Xms2816m
       --add-opens ...
     ```
   - **Validation**:
     - The heap size (`-Xmx2816m` and `-Xms2816m`) is reasonable for the allocated memory (`4.5Gi`).
     - Ensure `-Xms` and `-Xmx` are not set too high compared to the memory limit, leaving some space for non-heap memory (e.g., metaspace, thread stacks, and native memory).
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Set `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` instead of fixed heap sizes for better flexibility:
       ```yaml
       JVM_OPTIONS: >-
         -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70
         -XX:+UseG1GC
         --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
         ...
       ```
     - Use `G1GC` as the garbage collector for better performance under high load.

---

#### 5. **Termination Grace Period**
   - Current: `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 420`
   - **Validation**:
     - A high termination grace period (7 minutes) ensures graceful shutdown, but it may delay pod rescheduling during scaling.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - If possible, reduce this to 120–180 seconds, unless the application truly requires 420 seconds for cleanup.

---

#### 6. **PreStop Hook**
   - Current:
     ```yaml
     lifecycle:
       preStop:
         exec:
           command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 360"]
     ```
   - **Validation**:
     - The `sleep 360` preStop hook delays container termination but does not guarantee cleanup of in-flight requests.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Replace `sleep` with a proper shutdown script that ensures in-flight requests are processed and resources are released.

---

#### 7. **Concurrency and Load Testing**
   - **Validation**:
     - Ensure the application is stress-tested with tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to validate its ability to handle 5000 TPS under real-world conditions.
   - **Suggestion**:
     - Simulate third-party vendor response times (10–20 seconds) during load tests to measure latency and throughput.

---

### **Final Suggested Configuration**
Here is the updated Helm values file with the recommended changes:

```yaml
replicaCount: 8
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 4.5Gi
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m

```

---

### **Additional Notes**
1. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor CPU, memory, and request latency.
   - Monitor JVM metrics (e.g., heap usage, garbage collection).

2. **Third-party Vendor Handling**:
   - Implement retries and circuit breakers for vendor calls using libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix.

3. **Caching**:
   - If possible, cache XML transformations or frequent SOAP calls to reduce processing overhead.

4. **Scaling Strategy**:
   - Consider using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for dynamic scaling.
